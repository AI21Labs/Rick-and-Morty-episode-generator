Annoyed that he constantly calls on them without any gratitude, they go back home to play Minecraft, with the President quickly finding out. The resulting argument leads to a battle of egos that culminates in a fight in the White House between Rick and the President's security. Meanwhile, fearing she might be a clone made by Rick, Beth reunites with Jerry to figure out the truth. Shortly after, the entire family gets together to hide from Rick, but he tracks them down. Rick eventually submits to Jerry once again being a family member. Rick ends his conflict with the President by pretending to be Fly Fishing Rick, a Rick from a different reality, and calling a truce. The episode ends with the family happy to be together again, except for Rick who is disappointed about losing his dominant position.\nPost-credits scene:\nMr. Poopybutthole returns to apologize for not appearing in Season 3, but he has gotten married and has a wife and son.

They visit an otherworldly resort within an immortality field so Jerry won't be harmed while away. Jerry encounters Risotto Groupon, an alien who blames Rick for his kingdom being usurped. Risotto enlists Jerry in a plot to kill Rick, but Jerry backs out after Rick apologizes for ruining his marriage. The attempt fails, and Rick realizes Jerry's involvement, sparking a monologue of him accusing Jerry of deliberately acting helpless to guilt others into helping him, such as making Beth feel she was obligated to marry him. After Rick kills Risotto, he softens his attitude towards Jerry, but refuses to allow him to return to the family. Meanwhile, Summer deals with self-esteem issues as well. Her boyfriend, Ethan, leaves her for a larger-breasted girlfriend, and Summer attempts to enlarge her own breasts using one of Rick's devices. Her aim is off, and she grows to bizarre proportions. Morty wants to call Rick for assistance, but Beth refuses. Arrogantly trying to prove her own self-worth, Beth repeatedly fails to fix the problem and ends up turning Summer inside-out. Beth is then tricked into releasing three tiny technical support workers that were trapped inside the machine when she calls for tech support. Summer disappears to the campsite she and Ethan were supposed to go, still inside out. Beth turns herself inside out and talks to Summer. Once Morty figures out how the machine works, he restores Summer's size and spitefully uses it to deform Ethan in an act of vengeance.\nPost-credits scene:\nThe three tiny workers are enjoying their retirement next to a river. As an extremely deformed Ethan walks by, one of them is snatched by an eagle.\n##\nGenerate a Post-credits scene for the following Rick and Morty episode based on the plot.\nPlot:\nSaved from the Citadel ruins by Space Beth, Rick attempts to reset the settings on his portal gun, but accidentally sends everyone who has traveled interdimensionally to their original dimensions.

Rick and Morty escape and are chased by a few duplicates of themselves. The Smith household is flooded with other Ricks and Jerry develops a friendship with the good-natured \"Doofus Rick\". The real culprits seem to be an \"Evil\" Rick and his Evil Morty, who have been using Mortys' low intelligence brainwaves as a way to conceal themselves. They capture the original Rick and Morty, but the original Morty leads a rebellion of alternate Mortys and releases the original Rick.

Rick calls Summer, who transports them advanced armor suits. Morty then goes on a seemingly uncharacteristic killing spree before Rick knocks him out, and he and Arthricia—who desired to stop the Festival—storm the castle of the corrupt nobility who introduced it, slaughtering them. The planet's remaining inhabitants decide to create a new society; however, rioting breaks out over disputes, and one suggests keeping the Festival after all.
